# DiHow

Web Event Invitation for a DIY themed event hosted by IKEA.

Hosted on Netlify: https://dihow.netlify.app/

Project is built using:
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Parcel & Prettier


### Code Review
- You could wrap the hamburger/nav in a class with transition none and remove the class after page load to prevent the menu to pop up on reload.
- Remove comments in css if it's not code that you will use. 
- Use only one H1, in the code you have three.  
- The title in the footer could have a line break between 'Välkommen <-> till höst' and aligned in center on smaller devices with width less than 300px. 
- I really liked your project and the code is easy to follow. You have done a great job !!
